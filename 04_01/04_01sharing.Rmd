In this lesson, we learned about two functions for exporting your work from R:
`ggsave` from the `ggplot2` package for exporting images and `write_csv` from the
`readr` package for exporting tables. 


## Exporting images using `ggsave`

Here is the plot of infant height against weight, faceted by the month of the 
measurement.

```{r}
library(healthds)
library(tidyverse)

ggplot(growth_data, 
       aes(x = height_cm, y = weight_kg, color = id)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  facet_grid(cols = vars(months))
```

The astute observers among you will notice that Phil (accidentally)
swapped his x and y aesthetics in the videos: in the video lecture, he mapped
`weight_kg` to the x aesthetic and `height_cm` to the y aesthetic,
whereas in the guided practice he mapped `height_cm` to the x aesthetic and 
`weight_kg` to the y aesthetic. For purposes of illustration, whichever you do
is fine, but we will use here the version from the guided practice. 

The simplest use case of `ggsave` is as follows:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggsave("weight_vs_height.png")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
message("Saving 8.83 x 6.82 in image")
```

Running this code, there should now be a new .png image file on your computer's 
hard drive named `weight_vs_height.png`. If you are working from inside 
the `Lessons.Rproj` project, the file will be in the same folder. If you are
working on rstudio.cloud, the file will be visible in the files tab in the lower
left corner of your screen:

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width='60%', fig.cap = "**Image description: screen capture from rstudio.cloud project as of 08-Nov-2022**"}
knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath("04_01/04_01a.png"), rel_path = FALSE)
```

The message that is printed to your screen (`Saving 8.83 x 6.82 in image`) 
indicates that `ggsave` has selected the dimensions of the image file that 
is saved. In this case, the image is 8.83in wide by 6.82in tall. When you run
this code, the dimensions of the file may be
different. This is because the image size is determined by the 
size of the lower-right panel of your Rstudio session: if you make the horizontal
size larger and re-run the call to `ggsave` above, it will increase the width 
of the resulting image file. 

Inevitably, you will need to recreate an image, perhaps days or weeks after you
initially created it. At that point, it is hopeless to try to resize the panel
by trial and error to match the dimensions of the previous version. For this 
reason, it is recommended that you explicitly provide the dimensions in the call
to `ggsave`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggsave(filename = "weight_vs_height.png", width = 8, height = 4)
```

Now we have saved the plot as a .png image file that is 8in wide and 4in tall 
(note that the message about the dimensions is no longer printed to the screen, 
being redundant information). Since the first argument to `ggsave` is `filename`, 
you can rely upon the concept of positional matching (see Module 3, Lesson 3)
to avoid writing `filename = `:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggsave("weight_vs_height.png", width = 8, height = 4)
```

The `width` and `height` arguments are not the second and third arguments, 
so you cannot use positional matching to avoiding writing their names
explicitly. You also might be interested in changing the default units 
of measurement from inches to something more intuitive, like cm. To do so, 
use the `units` argument:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggsave("weight_vs_height.png", width = 18, height = 8, units = "cm")
```

The values of `width` and `height` should represent whatever units of measurement
you have specified, meaning that the code above would save the plot as an image
file 18cm wide and 8cm tall. 

Another useful piece of information is that the `filename` name argument can be a *path*
and not just a file name. Look at *but don't yet run* the following code:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggsave("module4/weight_vs_height.png", width = 18, height = 8, units = "cm")
```

Before the file name is `module4/`, which is a 'relative path' pointing to a
folder called 'module4'. The word 'relative' means that R will look for this folder
relative to your working directory, which, as long as you are working inside the
the 'Lessons' R project, will be the folder called 'Lessons'. So, in order
for this code to run without an error, you should first create on your computer
a new folder called 'module4' *inside of the 'Lessons' folder*. After doing so, 
run the code above. If you run the code without having created the 'module4' 
folder, you will encounter an error from R.

It is not required that you specify a relative path; however, doing so will save 
you some work if you would otherwise have to move the image file to a different
location after creating it. 

The last thing to observe about `ggsave` is that the second argument is named
`plot`, and in none of the examples above did we even bother to specify a value
for `plot`. How is this possible? This is possible because the default value 
for `plot` is to use the last plot that you created in R. So, if you were to 
run the following code on your computer, the resulting image files would 
contain distinct plots even though we did not specify the `plot` argument 
in either call to `ggsave`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(growth_data, 
       aes(x = height_cm, y = weight_kg, color = id)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  facet_grid(cols = vars(months))
ggsave("module4/weight_vs_height.png", width = 18, height = 8, units = "cm")

ggplot(growth_data, 
       aes(x = height_cm)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5) 
ggsave("module4/height_distribution.png", width = 18, height = 8, units = "cm")
```

In contrast, were you to run the following code, it would save the *same* plot
(namely, the histogram from the second block of code) twice -- one in a file
named 'weight_vs_height.png' and another in 'height_distribution.png':

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Don't run this code!
ggplot(growth_data, 
       aes(x = height_cm, y = weight_kg, color = id)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  facet_grid(cols = vars(months))

ggplot(growth_data, 
       aes(x = height_cm)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5) 

ggsave("module4/weight_vs_height.png", width = 18, height = 8, units = "cm")
ggsave("module4/height_distribution.png", width = 18, height = 8, units = "cm")
```

This is presumably not what you would intend. 

## Exporting tables using `write_csv`

You can write `data.frame`s (of which `tibble`s are special cases) to your
computer's hard drive using the `write_csv` function. Typically, the sort of 
`data.frame` that you would want to export would be tables of statistics or
results. However, we will demonstrate use of `write_csv` on the `growth_data`
object in the `healthds` packages. 

### Remark: `write_csv` versus `write.csv`

The `write_csv` function is part of the `tidyverse` and therefore the function 
that we will be using here. There is a similar-looking function called `write.csv` 
which comes pre-loaded as part of the base installation of R. Which functions 
you end up using is not critical -- `write_csv` will be faster when you are 
writing large `data.frame`s, and there are some other differences in other
default behavior. 

To use `write_csv`, we need to specify two arguments at a minimum: the name of
the `data.frame` (the `x` argument) to write and the desired filename (the
`file` argument). In contrast to `ggsave`, there is no default behavior to 
write the "last" `data.frame` used and so you need to explicitly indicate 
what `data.frame` you want to save to the computer via `x`. The `file` 
argument in `write_csv` is analogous to the `filename` argument in `ggsave`, 
but note that it comes *second* in `write_csv` and not first. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
write_csv(x = growth_data, file = "module4/growth_data.csv")
```

Like `ggsave`, this code will save the `growth_data` object to the folder named
'module4' that is within your current working directory, which is the 'Lessons'
folder in our case. We *don't* put quotes around `growth_data` because it is an
R object name; we *do* put quotes around `module4/growth_data.csv` because it
is not an R object but rather a path. 

You can use positional matching here, too, meaning that the following code has
the same behavior:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
write_csv(growth_data, "module4/growth_data.csv")
```

There will now be a new file with a '.csv' suffix in the module4 folder. You 
can distribute it just as you would any other file, and if you double-click it, 
it will open in your spreadsheet program.
