## 

In this final (and *bonus* -- meaning it does not have an accompanying
guided practice video) independent guide, we will walk through some more
complex functions within `ggplot2` that allow you to not only re-create the content
in Figure 1.1 of The Global Findex Database 2017 but also all of the same details:
color scheme, labels, etc. 

This content is beyond the scope of what we could practically cover in the course, 
which means much of it will be non-intuitive at first. The goal here is help
jumpstart your own self-directed learning by offering more advanced examples
within a context you are already familiar with. 

We first re-create the approximation to Figure 1.1 that we came up with by the
end of Module 3:

```{r, fig.width = 6.63, fig.cap = "**Image description: Initial approximation of Figure 1.1 from The Global Findex Database 2017**"}
library(tidyverse) 

micro_world <- 
  read_csv("micro_world.csv")

micro_world_account <-
  micro_world %>%
  group_by(economycode) %>%
  summarize(account = 
              100 * weighted.mean(account, w = wgt))

wb_income <- 
  read_csv("wb_income.csv")

account_by_income <-
  left_join(micro_world_account, 
            wb_income)

ggplot(data = account_by_income, 
       mapping = aes(x = account,
                     y = income_category,
                     color = income_category)) + 
  geom_point()
```

Compare this to the published version of Figure 1.1 from The Global Findex Database
2017, reproduced here:

```{r echo = FALSE,  out.width='70%', fig.cap = "**Image description: Figure 1.1 from The Global Findex Database 2017** (source: https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/29510)"}
knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath("03_01/figure11_globalfindex.png"), rel_path = FALSE)
```

To be sure, our plot and Figure 1.1 are clearly plotting the same data. 
However, if our goal was to replicate Figure 1.1, we fell short. In the following
sections, we will make incremental changes to our code to more precisely
replicate Figure 1.1. The list of changes we'll make are as follows:

1. Change the type and size of the points that are plotted
2. Add a title, subtitle, and caption to the plot
3. Drop the color legend on the right, match the color scheme
4. Increase the size of the text, drop the grey background, and make other minor
modifications to formatting

## 1. Change point-type, size

Notice from Figure 1.1 that each plotted point has a faint white border. This is
a special choice of the `shape` aesthetic. In fact, there are 25 different 
choices of the `shape` aesthetic available to you, all of which you can see in 
the table midway through 
[Section 12.2](https://ggplot2-book.org/scale-other.html#scale-shape)
of the ggplot2 book. The default choice for `geom_point` is to use the 19th value:
a filled circle. With this default choice, you cannot specify distinct choices for
the color of the *perimeter*  (or *border*) and the color of the *interior*, and 
this common color is controlled by the `color` aesthetic. On the other hand, if
we want to provide one color for the perimeter and another for the interior, 
we should instead use the 21st value, which appears as an empty circle. One 
cannot necessarily see this from the table, but the 21st-25th shape values 
all have two aesthetics that control their color:
the `fill` aesthetic controls the perimeter color and the `color` aesthetic
controls the interior color. This should hopefully sound familiar to you from 
Module 3, Lesson 2, in which we used the `fill` aesthetic for barplots. 

There is another new idea to learn here: the distincition between **mapping** an
aesthetic to a variable in your dataset versus **setting** an aesthetic value
to a constant value that does not depend on your data. We already know how to
map an aesthetic to a variable. For example, to map the `x` and `y` aesthetics, 
we write `aes(x = <VARIABLE_NAME>, y = <VARIABLE_NAME2>)` inside `geom_point`. 
If we want to *set* an aesthetic, we would provide it as an argument
inside `geom_point` but *outside* of the `aes()` call. In our case, we want to 
set three aesthetics to specific values: the `shape` should be set to 21 (as 
discussed in the previous paragraph), the `color` aesthetic, which controls the 
color of the perimeter, should be set to white, and the `size` aesthetic should
be set to a bigger number than its default value, which, for your information, 
is 1.5. In addition, we now want to map the `fill` aesthetic to the variable `income_category`, in contrast to what we were doing previously, which was 
mapping `color` to `income_category`. 

Putting this all together, Step 1 of our improvements are implemented with the
following code. 

```{r, fig.width = 6.63, fig.cap = "**Image description: Step 1 for updating Figure 1.1 from The Global Findex Database 2017**"}
figure1.1_step1 <- 
  ggplot(data = account_by_income, 
         mapping = aes(x = account,
                       y = income_category,
                       fill = income_category)) + 
  geom_point(shape = 21, color = "#FFFFFF", size = 4) 
figure1.1_step1
```

If you are not familiar with hexidecimal (hex) representation of colors, the
code `color = "#FFFFFF"` may look strange. Hex codes are formal ways of specifying
colors on computers. They are comprised of the number sign (`#`) followed by any
combination of the numbers 0-9 or the letters A-F. The code `"#FFFFFF"` is
the hex code for the color white. You can read more about hex codes on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors#Hex_triplet). 

There are a limited number of colors written as strings that R will recognize, 
`"white"` being one of them. So, you could also write `color = "white"` in the 
code above and get the same result. If you type `colors()` in your R console
and press Enter, you will see the entire set of colors that you can write as 
a string. 

## 2. Titles, subtitle, and caption

To add a title, subtitle, and caption, we use the `labs` function from Module 3, 
Lesson 3. In that lesson, we practiced changing the labels for aesthetics, e.g.
`x = <XLABEL>` AND `y = <YLABEL>`. But
`labs` also allows you to change the title (`title = <TITLE>`), subtitle 
(`subtitle = <SUBTITLE>`), and caption (`caption = <CAPTION>`). 

We also want to change the number and nature of the tick marks on the x and y
axes. Specifically, as you practiced in the Practice Quiz for Module 3, Lesson 3, 
we want to extend the limits of the x-axis to cover the smallest and largest possible
of 0 and 100 (`limits = c(0, 100)`), respectively, and we want the tick marks
to land at every increment of 20 (`breaks = c(0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100)`). 

As for the y-axis, we don't want to change the number or position of the tick 
marks but rather the labels for the existing tick marks. This is achieved by providing
a so-called "named vector": `c(<VALUE1> = <LABEL1>, <VALUE2> = <LABEL2>, ...)`
The VALUES should be the the values from your variable; in our case we have four:
`4High`, `3UpperMid`, `2LowerMid`, and `1Low`. And the LABELS can be whatever you
want to actually be shown. 

Putting this all together, Step 2 of our improvements are implemented with the
following code:

```{r, fig.width = 6.63, fig.cap = "**Image description: Step 2 for updating Figure 1.1 from The Global Findex Database 2017**"}
figure1.1_step2 <- 
  figure1.1_step1 +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 100), 
                     breaks = c(0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100)) + 
  scale_y_discrete(labels = c("4High" = "High-income countries",
                              "3UpperMid" = "Upper-middle-income countries",
                              "2LowerMid" = "Lower-middle-income countries",
                              "1Low" = "Low-income countries")) + 
  labs(x = "", # an empty string completely suppresses the label 
       y = "", 
       title = "Account ownership differs substantially even within income groups", 
       subtitle = "Adults with an account (%), 2017", 
       caption = "Source: Global Findex database") 
figure1.1_step2
```

We will address the issue with the figure title getting truncated in Step 4. 

Note that what we do above is create a new ggplot2 object called `figure1.1_step2`, 
which starts with the improvements from step 1 and adds our further modifications.
We then print the resulting new ggplot2 object `figure1.1_step2`. 

## 3. Drop legend, modify colors

In this third step, we want to do two things: (a) drop the legend on the right-hand
side of the plot, which is redundant because the y-axis already allows us to 
distinguish between each income category and (b) change the colors for each value
of `income_category` to match Figure 1.1. 


To modify the legend of an aesthetic, we use a `ggplot2`
function called `guides`. To completely suppress the legend for a particular 
aesthetic, as we desire here, we would write `guides(<AESTHETIC_NAME>="none")`. 

To change the colors that the `fill` aesthetic uses, we need to use a `scale`
function as we did in Step 2. Specifically, because we are mapping the `fill` 
aesthetic, we need to use a function that starts with `scale_fill`. Different 
from our previous experiences, we will use a function called `scale_fill_manual`, 
which is a function that allows for more customization of an aesthetic's 
values, since the color scheme for Figure 1.1 in The Global Findex Database 
2017 is (to the best of our knowledge) not a standard color scheme. Thus, 
we need to provide a named vector that communicates the value of `fill` that 
should correspond to each value of the `income_category` variable:
`c(<VALUE1> = <HEXCODE1>, <VALUE2> = <HEXCODE2>, ...)`. From top to bottom, 
the hex codes for the four colors are #6AA8BD, #D36033, #F3BC44, and #2D698C. 

Incorporating these two extensions into our plot from Step 2, we have:

```{r, fig.width = 6.63, fig.cap = "**Image description: Step 3 for updating Figure 1.1 from The Global Findex Database 2017**"}
figure1.1_step3 <- 
  figure1.1_step2 +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("4High" = "#6AA8BD",
                               "3UpperMid" = "#D36033",
                               "2LowerMid" = "#F3BC44",
                               "1Low" = "#2D698C")) + 
  guides(fill = "none")
figure1.1_step3
```

Helpfully, having now suppressed the printing of the legend for `fill`, 
`ggplot` automatically increases the size of the plotted panel to fill 
that space, making the plot seem less "squished". 

## 4. Increase text size, drop grey background

Finally, we will use the `theme` function from `ggplot2` to modify the overall
appearance of the plot. The function is complicated upon first introduction, 
which is the cost of the flexibility it provides. Because there are so many
options, we first provide the code for implementing Step 4 and then describe
how to interpret what we've done. 

```{r}
figure1.1_step4 <- 
  figure1.1_step3 +
  theme(axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
        axis.text = element_text(size = 11.5),
        panel.background = element_blank(),
        plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 13.5),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 11.5),
        plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0),
        plot.title.position = "plot",
        plot.caption.position = "plot")
```

Inside the call to `theme`, we have made the following choices:

* `axis.ticks.y = element_blank()` means that we want to completely suppress 
printing of the tick marks, but only along the y-axis. If we want to suppress
printing of the tick marks on the x-axis, we would use 
`axis.ticks.x = element_blank()`, and if we wanted to suppress printing on 
both axes at the same time, we could use `axis.ticks = element_blank()`

* `axis.text = element_text(size = 11.5)` means that we want to change 
the font size to 11.5 for all text elements related to each axis. Since we use
`axis.text` and not `axis.text.x` or `axis.text.y` (which are other arguments 
in theme), we are changing the font size for both axes

* `panel.background = element_blank()` suppresses the grey background that 
is shown by default

* `plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 13.5)` means that the
title will be plotted in boldface and with font size 13.5

* `plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 11.5)` means that the subtitle
will be plotted with font size 11.5

* `plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0)` means that the caption
will be left-justified and not right-justified (its default)

* `plot.title.position = "plot"` and `plot.caption.position = "plot"` means 
that the title and subtitle will be justified according to the edge of
entire *plot* instead of according to the edge of the *panel* containing the 
data (its default)


Having implemented Step 4, our final version looks like this:

```{r, fig.width = 6.63, fig.cap = "**Image description: Step 4 for updating Figure 1.1 from The Global Findex Database 2017**"}
figure1.1_step4
```

And, for comparison, here is Figure 1.1. again:

```{r echo = FALSE,  out.width='70%', fig.cap = "**Image description: Figure 1.1 from The Global Findex Database 2017** (source: https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/29510)"}
knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath("03_01/figure11_globalfindex.png"), rel_path = FALSE)
```

## Appendix

For reference, the entire code block for making our final version of the figure
is given here:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = account_by_income, 
       mapping = aes(x = account,
                     y = income_category,
                     fill = income_category)) + 
  geom_point(shape = 21, color = "#FFFFFF", size = 4)  +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 100), 
                     breaks = c(0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100)) + 
  scale_y_discrete(labels = c("4High" = "High-income countries",
                              "3UpperMid" = "Upper-middle-income countries",
                              "2LowerMid" = "Lower-middle-income countries",
                              "1Low" = "Low-income countries")) + 
  labs(x = "", # an empty string completely suppresses the label 
       y = "", 
       title = "Account ownership differs substantially even within income groups", 
       subtitle = "Adults with an account (%), 2017", 
       caption = "Source: Global Findex database") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("4High" = "#6AA8BD",
                               "3UpperMid" = "#D36033",
                               "2LowerMid" = "#F3BC44",
                               "1Low" = "#2D698C")) + 
  guides(fill = "none") +
  theme(axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
        axis.text = element_text(size = 11.5),
        panel.background = element_blank(),
        plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 13.5),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 11.5),
        plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0),
        plot.title.position = "plot",
        plot.caption.position = "plot")
```
