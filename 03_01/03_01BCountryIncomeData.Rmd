In Module 3, you will practice and reinforce your `ggplot2` skills by 
making Figure 1.1 from The Global Findex Database 2017, which you can see here:

```{r echo = FALSE,  out.width='70%', fig.cap = "**Image description: Figure 1.1 from The Global Findex Database 2017** (source: https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/29510)"}
knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath("03_01/figure11_globalfindex.png"), rel_path = FALSE)
```

The x-axis (the left-right direction) is a percentage, interpreted as a specific
country's overall account ownership. You will use the dataset we've already
analyzed in Module 2, which is saved in your GlobalFindex project folder on your
computer in a file named `micro_world.csv`, to calculate these percentages. 
However, the y-axis (the up-down direction) of this figure, which separates
these percentages by the World-Bank-designated income level of each country, is not 
available in `micro_world.csv`. These data are freely available from the World Bank
(https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/906519-world-bank-country-and-lending-groups). For completeness, we describe exactly how we obtained these data from
this url, but note that **a reduced version of the data are available for 
download directly for from the course website, as described in the next paragraph.** 

The data are taken from the .xlsx file that the link "[historical classification by income in XLSX format](http://databank.worldbank.org/data/download/site-content/OGHIST.xlsx)"
points to: 

```{r echo = FALSE,  out.width='70%', fig.cap = "**Image description: screen capture from https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/906519-world-bank-country-and-lending-groups as of 31-Oct-2022. The link pointing to country-level income is highlighted**"}
knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath("03_01/03_01BWorldBank.png"), rel_path = FALSE)
```

If you navigate to that second tab of the linked .xlsx file, which is entitled 
"Country Analytical History", we need the information between rows 12 and 229 
(inclusive) for two columns: column A identifies each country using its World Bank
abbreviation, and  column AE provides each country's designated income level in 
the year 2017 (the same year as The Global Findex Database 2017). Column AE has 
four possible values: L (low-income), LM (lower-middle-income), UM 
(upper-middle-income), and H (high-income), which correspond to y-axis labels 
on Figure 1.1.

You can download directly from the course website a .csv version of the 
income-level data that contains all of and only the information you need for 
Figure 1.1. The file is named `wb_income.csv`. We've also renamed the values of
the income levels ('L' is changed to '1Low', 'LM' is changed to '2LowerMid', 
'UM' is changed to '3UpperMid', and 'H' is changed to '4High'). Download and 
save this file into your GlobalFindex project folder before proceeding to the 
Practice Quiz for Module 3, Lesson 1. Note that you will need to join these 
two datasets onceyou've read them into R, using skills that you've already 
learned in Module 2.
