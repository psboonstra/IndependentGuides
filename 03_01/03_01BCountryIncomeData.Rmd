```{r setup, echo = FALSE}

```

In Module 3, you will practice and reinforce your `ggplot2` skills by 
making Figure 1.1 from The Global Findex Database 2017, which you can see here:

```{r echo = FALSE,  out.width='60%', fig.cap = "**Image description: Figure 1.1 from The Global Findex Database 2017** (source: https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/29510)"}
knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath("03_01/figure11_globalfindex.png"), rel_path = FALSE)
```

The x-axis (the left-right direction) is a percentage, interpreted as a specific
country's overall account ownership. You will use the dataset we've already
analyzed in Module 2, which is saved in your GlobalFindex project folder on your
computer in a file named `micro_world.csv`, to calculate these percentages. 
However, the y-axis (the up-down direction) of this figure, which separates
these percentages the World-Bank-designated income level of each country, is not 
available in `micro_world.csv`. These data are freely available from the World Bank
(https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/906519-world-bank-country-and-lending-groups), and for convenience you can download directly from the course website
a reduced version of these data that contains only the information necessary 
for Figure 1.1. 

The file is named `wb_income.csv` and you will need to download and save
this file into the GlobalFindex project folder before proceeding to the
Practice Quiz for Module 3, Lesson 1.
