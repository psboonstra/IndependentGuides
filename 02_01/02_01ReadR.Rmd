```{r setup, echo = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(out.extra='style="background-color: #999999; padding:7px; display: inline-block;"')
```


```{r klippy, echo = FALSE, include = TRUE}
klippy::klippy(position = c("top", "right"), tooltip_message = "Copy")
```

In this first lesson of Module 2, you were introduced to the `tidyverse`, a package
of packages that provides you with all of the tools for translating your data
into useful information and knowledge. One of the packages that comprises the `tidyverse` is `readr`, 
which contains tools for reading data into R. 

In Module 1, Lesson 2, you created an R project called `GlobalFindex.Rproj` and, 
in that same folder, you created a script called `IndicatorTable.R`. We will be
working inside that script now. Double click the `GlobalFindex.Rproj` file to open a new RStudio session. 
Then, open the `IndicatorTable.R` script. The easiest way to do so is to inspect 
the file tree in the bottom-right panel of your RStudio session and look for the file 
name (it will be there if you were able to successfully follow the instructions 
to create this script in Module 1). Click the file name:

```{r echo = FALSE,  out.width='60%', fig.cap = "**Image description: opening an existing script from the bottom-right file panel**"}
knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath("02_01/02_01a.png"), rel_path = FALSE)
```

If you haven't yet done so, put this code (that is, `library(tidyverse)`) on the 
first line of your `IndicatorTable.R` script and then run it by simultaneously 
pressing 'Cmd+Enter' (on your Mac) or 'Ctrl+Enter' (on your Windows computer). 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

If by chance you haven't created the `IndicatorTable.R` script, you can do so now:
press 'Cmd+Shift+N' (on your Mac) or 'Ctrl+Shift+N' (on your Windows computer)
to create a new script. Then, put the `library` command from above on the very
first line, then save the script by pressing 'Cmd+S' or 'Ctrl+S', choosing 
`IndicatorTable.R` as the file name. 


## `read_csv`

The function from the `readr` that we'll practice using here is the `read_csv`
function, which takes a computer file is saved as a **c**omma-**s**eparated **v**alue (csv)
format on your computer and reads it into your R session. 

Look for the .csv suffix on a computer file (ironically, if you double click that file to open it, most 
computers will use their spreadsheet software program, e.g. Excel, to view it, 
and you won't even see the commas that separate the values!).

To get the Global Findex data onto your computer, go to this url:

https://microdata.worldbank.org/index.php/catalog/3324/get-microdata

If you haven't already done so, you will need to register for a free account
before you can access the data. After logging in, download the data in CSV format. 
The ZIP file will be named `WLD_2017_FINDEX_v02_M_CSV.zip`, and when you unzip it
the resulting folder will contain a single file named `micro_world.csv`, which is 
the data we need. 

*If you are working on RStudio installed on your own computer*,  move this 
`micro_world.csv` file into the GlobalFindex project folder, e.g. by dragging 
and dropping. If you go back to RStudio now, the bottom-right of your RStudio
session should indicate that the `micro_world.csv` file is now in your directory:

```{r echo = FALSE,  out.width='60%', fig.cap = "**Image description: the GlobalFindex project after moving the data to the folder**"}
knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath("02_01/02_01b.png"), rel_path = FALSE)
```


*If you are working on RStudio from rstudio.cloud*, you will need to upload
the `micro_world.csv` data into your project. To do so, in the files panel, 
look for the 'Upload' button, which is unique to rstudio.cloud. 

```{r echo = FALSE,  out.width='60%', fig.cap = "**Image description: uploading the `micro_world.csv` into rstudio.cloud**"}
knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath("02_01/02_01c.png"), rel_path = FALSE)
```


Now we are ready to read in the data. In your `IndicatorTable.R` script, type the
following line of code, which will read in the Global Findex data stored in the
file named `micro_world.csv` and assign it  as an object in your R session entitled
`micro_world`:

```{r}
micro_world <- read_csv("micro_world.csv")
```

Remember, typing the line of code in your script doesn't run the code; at this 
point it is only a set of instructions to be run. Tell R to run the code by pressing
'Cmd+Enter' (Mac) or 'Ctrl+Enter' (Windows). If successfully run, you should see 
output in your console similar to what you see above: some information
about the numbers of rows and columns in your data and the variable (column) names. 
If you get an error that says `Error: object 'read_csv' not found`, it is likely
because you did not first load the `tidyverse`, which contains the `read_csv` function.

The last thing to do is save your work. Because you've made changes, the file 
name looks like <span style="color: red;">`IndicatorTable.R*`</span>. Save your 
script by pressing 'Cmd+S' or 'Ctrl+S', and the file name once again becomes `IndicatorTable.R`.

You will continue to develop your `IndicatorTable.R` script in your Assessments, 
and in subsequent Independent Guides we will use the 'Lessons' project.
